## Status
After running through the steps for the deliverable video, the application is able to:
create threads, and have a semaphore be unblocked by a separate process. When killed, each process ends\
gracefully.
## Known Issues
The output when Thread Factory are killed , looks a little goofy, where it prints the final message while other
threads are being destroyed, I believe this is just a factor of what order events are being processed. I don't believe the final message
was a requirement (rather just a way for me to track if events proceeded as expected. So it is not a problem.
## Expected Grade
I feel I have met the requirements of this assignment and should get full grades, 100%. If I have made any other errors (as in the way this
assignment is submitted for instance) I could not have forseen these, apologize and would feel I would still deserve 90%. Thank you.

NOTE: if we are still going to use Github, I would like to make this repo my main repo. When I make future readme's I will name them specifically like I  have
for this one.
